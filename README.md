# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This is a study guide covering the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. To create this project I used a combination of coding tools such as Git Bash, VS Code, and Chrome Dev. This was created to help create an easy,organized access point for all of my notes while teaching me the foundations of coding.
